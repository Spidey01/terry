# Linux systems sometimes argue about en_US.UTF-8 and en_US.utf8.
#
# For example my Debian systems set LANG=en_US.UTF-8 from the get go.  And then
# I ssh into another Debian system and perl moans about LANG because it wants
# en_US.utf8 \o/.
#
# Well behaved linux systems, both Debian and Red Hat, will use either.
#
LANG=en_US.utf-8

#
# Debian systems use this file to indicate a chroot environment. Such as using
# schroot -c some_chroot = /etc/debian_chroot contains 'some_chroot'.
